9241704,"Risk factors for venous thrombosis: prevalence, risk, and interaction.",1997 Jul,Rosendaal FR,"Annually, 1 in 1,000 individuals is affected by venous thrombosis. Risk factors that are known to increase the risk of thrombosis may be either genetic or acquired, or have a combined origin. Many of these risk factors are very frequent, among which several have been recently identified, such as resistance to activated protein C by factor V Leiden, hyperhomocysteinemia, high levels of factors VIII, as well as the classical acquired risk factors, such as surgery and malignancies. When the prevalence of risk factors is high, it becomes likely that in some individuals two or more risk factors will be present simultaneously. The question ""What happens to the risk in these circumstances?"" is one involving interaction, also known as effect modification or synergy. In this article we review the prevalence and risk estimates for the various genetic and acquired risk factors for venous thrombosis, discuss the concept of interaction, and give an overview of the evidence for interaction of these risk factors."
9241710,Familial thrombophilia: a complex genetic disorder.,1997 Jul,"Koeleman BP, Reitsma PH, Bertina RM","Familial thrombosis has long been considered as an autosomal dominant trait, caused by a dominant gene defect with a reduced penetrance for the disease. Recently, this view has changed and today familial thrombophilia is considered as a complex genetic disorder caused by the segregation of two or more gene defects (known and unknown) in a family. Here we briefly discuss the known genetic defects (protein C, protein S, and antithrombin deficiency and activated protein C resistance associated with factor V Leiden) with special focus on the relation between gene mutation and plasma abnormality and on the association between abnormality and thrombosis in affected families and in the population. Finally, the evidence is reviewed that indicates familial thrombosis as an oligogenetic disorder and on the basis of these data strategies are discussed for the identification of new genetic risk factors for thrombosis via a genetic approach."
7742535,Assessment of aldehyde dehydrogenase in viable cells.,1995 May 15,"Jones RJ, Barber JP, Vala MS, Collector MI, Kaufmann SH, Ludeman SM, Colvin OM, Hilton J","Cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), an enzyme responsible for oxidizing intracellular aldehydes, has an important role in ethanol, vitamin A, and cyclophosphamide metabolism. High expression of this enzyme in primitive stem cells from multiple tissues, including bone marrow and intestine, appears to be an important mechanism by which these cells are resistant to cyclophosphamide. However, although hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) express high levels of cytosolic ALDH, isolating viable HSC by their ALDH expression has not been possible because ALDH is an intracellular protein. We found that a fluorescent aldehyde, dansyl aminoacetaldehyde (DAAA), could be used in flow cytometry experiments to isolate viable mouse and human cells based on their ALDH content. The level of dansyl fluorescence exhibited by cells after incubation with DAAA paralleled cytosolic ALDH levels determined by Western blotting and the sensitivity of the cells to cyclophosphamide. Moreover, DAAA appeared to be a more sensitive means of assessing cytosolic ALDH levels than Western blotting. Bone marrow progenitors treated with DAAA proliferated normally. Furthermore, marrow cells expressing high levels of dansyl fluorescence after incubation with DAAA were enriched for hematopoietic progenitors. The ability to isolate viable cells that express high levels of cytosolic ALDH could be an important component of methodology for identifying and purifying HSC and for studying cyclophosphamide-resistant tumor cell populations."

1450480,Peritoneal transfer of carbon dioxide in the rat.,1992 Oct-Dec,"Grzegorzewska AE, Moore HL, Chen TW, Nolph KD","In the authors' previous rat studies (Kidney Int 39: 608-617, 1991), peritoneal clearances (Cp) representing near exclusively diffusive CO2 transfer were evaluated: for isosmotic (0.37% dextrose) and hyperosmotic (15% dextrose) solutions with pH 7.2-7.3, Cp CO2 were 1.20 +/- 0.08 and 1.84 +/- 0.04 ml/min, respectively. In the present studies peritoneal transfer parameters (D/B, Cp) of CO2 gas, HCO3-, and total CO2 (tCO2) in anesthetized rats have been compared (n = 22) using solutions with dextrose contents as mentioned above but with a pH of 6.5 or 7.6; how much Cp CO2 measurements obtained with solutions at these pH values differ from Cp shown earlier with solutions of pH 7.2-7.3 has also been evaluated. When the pH was the same, transfer parameters of CO2 gas, HCO3-, and tCO2 were significantly higher under hyperosmotic conditions. The use of solutions with a pH different from 7.2-7.3 resulted in higher Cp of CO2 gas: with isosmotic solutions at pH 6.5 and 7.6, mean increases were 25 and 75%, respectively; with hyperosmotic solutions respective increases were 45 and 134%. The authors conclude that dialysis solution pH, especially under hyperosmotic conditions, significantly changes parameters of diffusive CO2 transfer in the rat. For evaluation of peritoneal blood flow from diffusive transfer parameters of CO2 gas, smaller overestimation can be expected when dialysis solution pH is slightly under than overadjusted compared to blood pH."
8164741,Mutation in blood coagulation factor V associated with resistance to activated protein C.,1994 May 5,"Bertina RM, Koeleman BP, Koster T, Rosendaal FR, Dirven RJ, de Ronde H, van der Velden PA, Reitsma PH","Activated protein C (APC) is a serine protease with potent anticoagulant properties, which is formed in blood on the endothelium from an inactive precursor. During normal haemostasis, APC limits clot formation by proteolytic inactivation of factors Va and VIIIa (ref. 2). To do this efficiently the enzyme needs a nonenzymatic cofactor, protein S (ref. 3). Recently it was found that the anticoagulant response to APC (APC resistance) was very weak in the plasma of 21% of unselected consecutive patients with thrombosis and about 50% of selected patients with a personal or family history of thrombosis; moreover, 5% of healthy individuals show APC resistance, which is associated with a sevenfold increase in the risk for deep vein thrombosis. Here we demonstrate that the phenotype of APC resistance is associated with heterozygosity or homozygosity for a single point mutation in the factor V gene (at nucleotide position 1,691, G-->A substitution) which predicts the synthesis of a factor V molecule (FV Q506, or FV Leiden) that is not properly inactivated by APC. The allelic frequency of the mutation in the Dutch population is approximately 2% and is at least tenfold higher than that of all other known genetic risk factors for thrombosis (protein C (ref. 8), protein S (ref. 9), antithrombin10 deficiency) together."
7877648,"Mutation in the gene coding for coagulation factor V and the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and venous thrombosis in apparently healthy men.",1995 Apr 6,"Ridker PM, Hennekens CH, Lindpaintner K, Stampfer MJ, Eisenberg PR, Miletich JP","A specific point mutation in the gene coding for coagulation factor V is associated with resistance to degradation by activated protein C, a recently described abnormality of coagulation that may be associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Whether this mutation also predisposes patients to arterial thrombosis is unknown, as is the value of screening for the mutation in order to define the risk of venous thrombosis among unselected healthy people."
